# Hotel-Database
Jared Kaiser 
Project Phase 2
Database Management Systems

-Code Functionality
    This code is using python to connect to MySQL and use a specific database created there
    it takes an input of 1-6 to answer the questions outlined in the assignment page. The database it is connected to is 
    a hotel database that we have worked on throughout the class.

-Intended Use
    This program is made for phase 2 of the Database Management Systems Course.
    This program is only to be turned in through canvas and to be used in job interviews in which they ask for what I did in my time at NMSU

-Commands to Run for Each Question
    #1 python proj.py -a 1
    #2 python proj.py -a 2
    #3 python proj.py -a 3
    #4 python proj.py -a 4
    #5 python proj.py -a 5
    #6 python proj.py -a 6

-Summary 
    The hardest part of the process was making the test data because it was a boring yet important process.
     I liked working on the project and all of the queries however the hard part is the test data. It takes a
     long time to compose even if using the easiest values possible. It was not that bad when I went back to make more test 
     data for the specific questions.
    The most rewarding thing from this project was writing the Python code because I have never coded in python before but 
    wanted the challenge of doing so and with the code snippets that were provided in the powerpoints for the class I was 
    able to understand it pretty easily. I also really enjoyed learning how to make the code work together with the database 
    and I feel like this is knowlegde that I could use in the future.
